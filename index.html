<h3>Matthew Standage</h3>
<h1>User experience, typography and information&nbsp;design</h1>
<p class="stand-first">Hi, I’m Matt, a designer based in the UK. I focus on typography, information design, and the user experience of mostly digital products and services. I’m passionate about transforming the complex into the simple; creating products and services people want to use; and providing content that is enjoyable to read and easy to understand.</p>
<p>I currently work as a Senior Product Designer at Bottomline Technologies working on complex financial products. In this role, I utilize various techniques from usability research and expert evaluation to sketching, wireframing, and visual design.</p>

<h4>Expertise &amp; background</h4>
<p>I specialize in designing systems that help to solve complex problems. By combining a background in typography and information design, with experience working on user-centered design projects I focus on supporting users’ understanding and ability to make informed decisions. I am particularly interested in accessibility, quantitative ways of measuring the success of design, and bridging the gap between design and development.</p>
<p>I graduated with an MA (with distinction) in Information Design and hold a first-class honours degree in Graphic Communication from the world-renowned Department of Typography &amp; Graphic Communication at the University of Reading. I continue to support the University as a Guest Lecturer teaching User Experience Strategy to the MA Communication Design students. While studying at Reading I received an examiner’s award for excellence in design practice and my dissertation. I was also awarded the Vince Ma Memorial Prize for outstanding academic achievement.</p>
<p>I was also a finalist at UXUK awards for my MA project work focused on encouraging behavioral change to reduce energy consumption.</p>
